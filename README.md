GoalTracker is a productivity and self-improvement web app designed to help you plan, organize, and track your goals — from your big yearly dreams to your daily tasks.
The system connects your goals, progress, and achievements into one cohesive structure that keeps you motivated and consistent.

🌟 Core Idea

The app follows a linked goal system:

Every Yearly goal becomes your north star — your long-term vision.

Monthly, Weekly, and Daily goals are all connected to those higher-level goals.

As you make progress on smaller goals, your higher-level goals update automatically, giving you visible, interconnected growth.

🧭 How It Works
🗓️ Goal Hierarchy

Yearly Goals — Start here. These define what you ultimately want to achieve.

Monthly Goals — Break down the yearly vision into milestones.

Weekly Goals — Divide your monthly progress into manageable chunks.

Daily Goals — The smallest actionable steps that move everything else forward.

💡 Always start with your yearly goals — they’re the foundation for every other goal type.

🔗 Goal Linking System

When creating a new goal, you can link it to others (for example, a daily goal linked to a weekly one).
This keeps your progress unified and consistent:

Completing smaller tasks directly contributes to larger goals.

You’ll see progress ripple upward across all linked goals.

Some goals might stand alone — and that’s fine too.

📈 Progress & Points

Each goal can grant progress points that define how much it contributes to the next goal up.
For example:

If a weekly goal requires completing a daily goal 5 times, set the daily goal’s progress to 20% (100 / 5 = 20).

The point system encourages balanced goal-setting — avoid overloading daily goals with too many points.
The goal is realistic consistency, not inflated numbers.

💾 Saved List

You can save frequently used or repeating goals (like daily habits or recurring tasks).
This makes setting up your next week or month fast, smooth, and consistent.

🏅 Achievements System

Your progress earns points, and your points unlock achievements.
Each achievement celebrates your growth and consistency:

The system tracks percentage-based thresholds — achievements can’t be cheated with inflated points.

Expect categories like Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme, Challenging, or Champion — each with its own visual flair and glow.

⚖️ Balance & Motivation

Balance your effort between short-term and long-term goals.
It’s not just about finishing — it’s about sustainable growth, focus, and pride in your daily discipline.

🎉 Final Words

Believe in yourself. Work hard. Stay disciplined.
Progress a little every day — and have fun doing it.

This app isn’t just about goals — it’s about building the person who achieves them.

Thank you for using GoalTracker — and best of luck on your journey 🚀
